### Data cleaning

**Temporary table `customer_orders_clean`**
- Create temporary table `customer_orders_clean`
- Add row numbers to indicate pizza number
- Convert string `'null'` and blank `''` values to `NULL`

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_orders_clean AS
SELECT
  row_number() over() AS pizza_number,
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  pizza_id,
  CASE
    WHEN exclusions IN ('null', '') THEN NULL
    ELSE exclusions
  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
    WHEN extras IN ('null', '') THEN NULL
    ELSE extras
  END AS extras,
  order_time
FROM
  customer_orders;
```

**Temporary table `runner_orders_clean`**
- `pickup_time`: convert `'null'` values to `NULL` and cast to timestamp
- `distance`: convert `'null'` values to `NULL`, remove 'km' suffix and cast to numeric type
- `duration`: convert `'null'` values to `NULL`, remove `'min', 'minute', 'minutes'` suffixes and cast to integer
- `cancellation`: convert `'null'` values to `NULL`

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS runner_orders_clean AS
SELECT
  order_id,
  runner_id,
  CASE
    WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL
    ELSE pickup_time :: timestamp
