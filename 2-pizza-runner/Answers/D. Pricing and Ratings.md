# Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
## ðŸ’µ D. Pricing and Ratings
**1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?**

```sql
SELECT
  sum(
    CASE
      WHEN pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
      ELSE 10
    END
  ) AS total
FROM
  customer_orders_clean
  LEFT JOIN runner_orders_clean USING (order_id)
  LEFT JOIN pizza_names USING(pizza_id)
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
```

| total |
|-------|
| 138   |

2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
- Add cheese is $1 extra

**3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.**

```sql
CREATE TABLE ratings (order_id int, rating int);

INSERT INTO
  ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES
  (1, 4),
  (2, 5),
  (3, 2),
  (4, 5),
  (5, 5),
  (7, 3),
  (8, 4),
  (10, 1);

SELECT
  *
FROM
  ratings;
```


**4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?**
- `customer_id`
- `order_id`
- `runner_id`
- `rating`
- `order_time`
- `pickup_time`
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas

```sql 
SELECT
  customer_id,
  order_id,
  runner_id,
  rating,
  order_time,
  pickup_time,
  date_part('minutes', pickup_time - order_time) AS time_between_order_and_pickup,
  duration,
  round(distance :: numeric /(duration :: numeric / 60.0), 1) AS speed,
  count(order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM
  customer_orders_clean
  LEFT JOIN runner_orders_clean USING(order_id)
  LEFT JOIN ratings USING(order_id)
WHERE
  cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY
  customer_id,
  order_id,
  runner_id,
  rating,
  order_time,
  pickup_time,
  time_between_order_and_pickup,
  duration,
  speed
ORDER BY
  customer_id;
```

**5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?**

```sql
SELECT
  138 - sum(runner_paid) AS money_left
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      order_id,
      round(avg(distance), 1) AS distance,
      sum(distance) * 0.3 AS runner_paid
    FROM
      runner_orders_clean
    WHERE
      cancellation IS NULL
    GROUP BY
      order_id
  ) a;
```

| money_left |
|------------|
| 94.44      |
