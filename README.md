# **8 Week SQL Challenge**

This repo contains my answers to case studies posted on [**8 Week SQL Challenge**](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) created by [**Data with Danny**](https://datawithdanny.com). 

### *Notes*

I am using **PostgreSQL** to tackle the questions posed in the case studies. Each case study is in a separate folder. For each study, there's `data.sql` file with scripts I used to create schema and insert data.
